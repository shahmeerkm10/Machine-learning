# Machine-learning
A repository of two jupyter notebook files that were used for two kaggle competitions i took part in, challenge 1 i.e. classification and chalenge 2 i.e. regression.

The notebooks also contain markdowns for explanation and the code to get the best result for my submissions for the competition.

They serve as part of the Machine Learning course delivered by Miss Solat Jabeen Sheikh, a lecturer at IBA Karachi.
